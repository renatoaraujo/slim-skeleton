# slim-skeleton
Simple skelleton for PHP [Slim Framework](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim) I did for myself.

Not finished but any help are welcome :)
Working currently in better router and database layer.

1.
Clone the repo into your PATH
```
$ git clone https://github.com/renatoaraujo/slim-skeleton.git
```

2.
Install all dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
```
$ composer install
```

3.
Edit the PATH/src/config/config-example.php with your database configurations and change the name for config.php @@ OBS: DATABASE NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

4.
Set up your vhosts for slim-skeleton/public or run the following command and access by web browser
```
$ php -S localhost:3000 public/
```
